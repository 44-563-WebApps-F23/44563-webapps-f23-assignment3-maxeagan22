    <body>
        <p>I am a computer science major here at Northwest Missouri State University. 
            One fact the most poeple don't know about me is that I am a triplet, 
            dont see many of those around here. Some of the things I enjoy doing is playing video games, 
            watching football, mostly the Chiefs.
            Hanging out with friends, go to the lake, and talking my dog for walks.

        <h2>Cheeseburgers</h2>
        <p>
            If I really had to pick a favorite food, I would probably have to go with a nice cheeseburger.
            There is obiously a lot of foods that I love to eat and it definetly hard for me to pick just one.
            The reason I chose Cheeseburgers as my favorite food because there is just so many ways to eat them.
            You can add cheese, lettuce, tomatos, pickles, onions, basically anything you want.
            Just the amount of different ways you can make and enjoy a cheeseburger makes it one of my
            favorite foods out there.
