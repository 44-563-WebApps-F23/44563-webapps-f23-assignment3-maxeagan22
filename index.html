        <h3>Favorite Vacation Spot: Lake of the Ozarks</h3>
            <P><b>Lake of the ozarks is the most popular lake destination in the state of Missouri.</b>
            As someone who has always loved being on the water and usually don't love traveling, I have always
                really enjoyed going to the Ozarks for those reasons. <b>My absolute favorite thing</b> to
                do there is to just be on the lake. Whether it is boating, skiing, tubing, jet skiing, or even just swimming,
            being on the water is always one of favorite things to do.</P>
